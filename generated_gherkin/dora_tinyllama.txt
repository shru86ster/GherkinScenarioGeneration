For the following requirement, generate Gherkin scenarios: The application should fetch live market prices with a latency of less than 1 second.
Feature: Live Market Prices Fetching

Scenario: Successful Fetching of Live Market Prices
Given the user has authorized the application to fetch live market prices
And the application has been recently launched with a new timestamp
When the application calls the live market prices API
Then the application should retrieve live market prices with a latency of less than 1 second
And the retrieved prices should be accurate

Scenario: Failed Fetching of Live Market Prices Due to Low Latency
Given the user has authorized the application to fetch live market prices
And the application has been recently launched with a low timestamp
When the application calls the live market prices API
Then the application should retrieve live market prices with a latency of less than 1 second
But the retrieved prices should be inaccurate

Scenario: Failed Fetching of Live Market Prices Due to API Interruption
Given the user has authorized the application to fetch live market prices
And the application has been recently launched with a high timestamp
When the application calls the live market prices API
Then the application should receive an error message
And the application should attempt to retrieve live market prices again after a delay of 5 seconds
Until the API becomes available again
