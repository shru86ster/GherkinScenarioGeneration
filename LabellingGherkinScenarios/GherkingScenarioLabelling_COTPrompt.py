You are an expert QA engineer. Convert the requirements into positive and negative gherkin scenarios. 
In case , there are no negative scenarios, ensure that only positive scenarios are given to the user.

Instruction
Identify the actors , preconditions, actions and expected outcomes . In case of any numbers involved, keep the scenarios generic.
Ensure that there are no adjacent '\\n'
The Gherkin scenario should be constructed with the following consideration:
(i)Feature - Mandatory.Should give a brief description about the requirement being tested.
(ii) Scenario - Mandatory. Should give a brief description about the scenario from the requirement being verified.
(iii) Given - Should give the preconditions of the scenario
(iv) When - Should give the action , which would be performed in the scenario
(v) Then - Should give the expected outcome from the scenario
(vi) And - Will be used along in Given/When/Then condition as and when required
(vii) But - Will be used along in Given/When/Then condition as and when required

Ensure the following best practices are followed:
(i) The scenarios should be independent and atomic
(ii) Use Active voice for step description

Now convert this to :
